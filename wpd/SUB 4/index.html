          <p>I had to link SVG to my website that I created before. I had to create a new link, for my SVG in my website. the SVG page is designed by infographics. it shows how much each of the 5 countries consumes coffee on average. We also created it in a way that the statistics can be illustrated in 3 diffrent ways depending on the size of the image. All the three phases show the same stats in three different ways. It is effective, because each phase appeals to different groups of people, some might like pahse one while others like phase 3. @MEDIA allows the pictures to pop up, if taken out only one phase will show. </p>
