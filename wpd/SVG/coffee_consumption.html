    <p> Each infographic can be customized to fitthe website design using an interface. The code displays pictures. It also displays the size of the pictures. When  @media is inserted the screen allows the  pictures to pop up. but when the code is taken out there will only be one picture that shows up. The infographics allows us to see whch pictures change at certain sizes. An example would be infographic_small, when the code is taken out the pictures didnt change when i made decreased/increasedm the width. These infographics are visual representations of data taht is presented in many different ways.</p>
